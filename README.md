# Prime Numbers

This calculation is written in javascript, and its execution is really simple. The purpose was to cover two different approaches (a direct approach, and an efficient one, as user's can type really long numbers).

You just need to:
* Clone this repository
* Run `yarn install`
* Then access the script folder and call it `node <script name>`

It is based on node.js and prompts.
